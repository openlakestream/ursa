 * Minimal start/stop lifecycle contract for the long-running runners that the

 *
 * <p>Introduced so that the orchestrator can drive
 * {@link #start()} / {@link #stop()} on runners without importing
 * lakehouse-specific runner classes. Concrete implementations (e.g. lakehouse
 * publish / commit / cleaner runners) live in their respective integration
 * modules and implement this interface.
