/**
 * Sink-neutral factory for the long-running compaction runners and storage
 * helpers the orchestrator needs.
 *
 * <p>Introduced so that {@code CompactionScheduler} no longer has
 * to import lakehouse-specific runner classes directly. Each integration module
 * (lakehouse today, clickhouse later) provides a concrete bindings
 * implementation that wires up its own concrete runners.
 *
 * <p>The runners returned here are exposed as {@link StartStopRunner} so the
 * orchestrator only sees the lifecycle contract — the concrete classes
 * ({@code PublishCompactTaskRunner}, {@code CompactedTaskRunner},
 * {@code AsyncCompactedDataCleaner}, {@code CompactedDataCleanupHandler}) remain
 * inside the integration module along with their heavy lakehouse-specific
 * transitive dependencies. This keeps the abstraction in {@code ursa-storage-core}
 * while avoiding a hard move of every runner class into core.
 *
 * <p>{@link #createTopicManager()} returns a core-level {@link TopicManager}; the
 * concrete impl can live in any integration module ({@code OxiaTopicManager}
 * already implements this interface from core).
