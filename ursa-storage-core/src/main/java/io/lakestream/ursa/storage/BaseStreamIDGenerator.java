/**
 * BaseStreamIDGenerator is an interface for generating unique identifiers for streams
 * in the Ursa storage system. This interface is designed to provide a flexible way
 * to generate IDs that are unique within the context of a specific stream.
 *
 * Key points to consider when using this interface:
 * 1. Implementations should ensure that generated IDs are unique for each stream.
 * 2. The generation process should be efficient, as it may be called frequently.
 * 3. Generated IDs should be suitable for use in distributed environments.
 * 4. Implementations may use different strategies (e.g., in-memory counters, distributed
 *    ID generators) depending on the specific requirements of the storage system.
 *
 * This interface is typically used in conjunction with other components of the
 * Ursa storage system, such as materialization services and StorageApi implementations.
 *
 * @see io.lakestream.ursa.storage.impl.compaction.CompactFileIDGenerator

     * @return A String representing the generated unique identifier.
     * @throws IDGeneratorException If there's an error during ID generation.
     *
     * Note: Implementations should ensure that:
     * 1. The generated ID is unique within the context of the given streamId.
     * 2. The method is thread-safe, as it may be called concurrently for different streams.
     * 3. The generation process is fast and efficient to avoid becoming a bottleneck.
     * 4. The generated ID format is consistent and compatible with other parts of the system
     *    that may use or store these IDs.
